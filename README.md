# Understanding Greenhouse Gas Trends: A Temporal Analysis of UK Emissions (2005â€“2022)

This project conducts a temporal analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United Kingdom from 2005 to 2022, with a particular focus on the impact of COVID-19. Using open government data, it applies a range of time-series techniques to examine historical patterns, identify significant disruptions, and evaluate the UK's long-term progress toward climate goals.

## Objectives

- Analyze long-term GHG emission trends in the UK between 2005 and 2022
- Assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on national emissions
- Identify which sector's emissions were most impacted by COVID-19

## Methods

The following time-series analysis techniques were used:
- Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Simple and Double Exponential Smoothing
- Interrupted Time Series (ITS) Analysis


This project received a grade of 70.
